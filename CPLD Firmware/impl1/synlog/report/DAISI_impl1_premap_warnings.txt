@W: BN132 :"/media/sf_Downloads/Code/DAISI/CPLD Firmware/top.v":75:12:75:29|Removing user instance data_buffer_inst_2 because it is equivalent to instance data_buffer_inst_1. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT529 :"/media/sf_Downloads/Code/DAISI/CPLD Firmware/spi_interface.v":9:0:9:5|Found inferred clock top|osc_clk_inferred_clock which controls 6 sequential elements including spi_interface_inst.signal. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.

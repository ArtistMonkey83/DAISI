WARNING - map: Using local reset signal 'reset' to infer global GSR net.
WARNING - map: The Oscillator 'OSCH_inst' is controlled by the power controller
     'pcm1/PCNTR_Inst0', causing the I2C, SPI, Timer/Counter, Wishbone and SED
     features unavailable for use when the Oscillator is disabled.
WARNING - map: BANDGAP turned off dynamically by Power controller
     'pcm1/PCNTR_Inst0'. When the BANDGAP circuitry is turned off, POR
     circuitry, analog circuits PLL, oscillator, Inputs (MIPI, SSTLXX, HSTL18,
     LVCMOSXXD, SSTLXXD,HSTL18D, LVTTL33D, LVCMOSXXRXX, LVDS25, RSDS25, BLVDS25,
     MLVDS25 and LVPECL33), Outputs (LVDS25 true only), Bidir (MIPI_LP, SSTLXX,
     HSTL18 , LVCMOSXXD, SSTLXXD, HSTL18D, LVTTL33D, BLVDS25E and MLVDS25E) are
     turned off.
WARNING - map: POR turned off dynamically by Power controller
     'pcm1/PCNTR_Inst0'. POR is only released when SFLAG is cleared.
WARNING - map: Power controller 'pcm1/PCNTR_Inst0' dynamic BANDGAP option is
     enabled. The design contains oscillator component which will be disabled
     when BANDGAP is turned off.
WARNING - map: Power controller 'pcm1/PCNTR_Inst0' dynamic BANDGAP option is
     enabled. The design contains PLL component(s) which will be disabled when
     BANDGAP is turned off.
WARNING - map: The reset of EBR 'top_reveal_coretop_instance/top_la0_inst_0/trig
     _u/te_0/genblk1.te_tt_ebr_ram/pmi_ram_dpXbnonesadr112112p12e1aace_0_0_0'
     cannot be controlled. The local reset is not connected to any control
     signal and set to GND. The global reset is disabled via GSR property. To
     control the EBR reset, either connect the local reset to a control signal
     or force the GSR property to be enabled.
WARNING - map: Multiple comps assigned to site "40". Only one comp will be
     assigned to this location.
WARNING - map: In "LOCATE COMP "spi_clk" SITE "44" ;": Current SYS_CONFIG
     setting prohibits pin "44" to be used as user IO. This preference has been
     disabled.
WARNING - map: In "LOCATE COMP "spi_mosi" SITE "71" ;": Current SYS_CONFIG
     setting prohibits pin "71" to be used as user IO. This preference has been
     disabled.

     setting prohibits pin "45" to be used as user IO. This preference has been
     disabled.
WARNING - map: In "LOCATE COMP "spi_csn" SITE "40" ;": Current SYS_CONFIG

<A name="mrp_gsr"></A><B><U><big>GSR Usage</big></U></B>
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'reset' of the design has been inferred as Global Set
        Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'reset'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components on inferred reset domain with GSR Property disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED and are on the
     inferred reset domain. The components will respond to the reset signal
     'reset' via the local reset on the component and not the GSR component.

     Type and number of components of the type: 
   Register = 2 
   EFB = 1

     Type and instance name of component: 
   Register :
        top_reveal_coretop_instance/top_la0_inst_0/trig_u/tu_0/input_a_d1[0]
   Register : top_reveal_coretop_instance/top_la0_inst_0/tm_u/trace_din_d[0]
